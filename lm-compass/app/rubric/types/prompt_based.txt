## Answer Quality Rubric for LLM Judges (0-100 Scale)

Correctness & Accuracy (25 points) — Ensures claims are factually accurate and verifiable, addressing the most critical concern of hallucination-free responses. This is weighted highest because inaccurate information undermines all other qualities.

Completeness (20 points) - Verifies the answer addresses all aspects of the query without significant omissions. This prevents shallow or partial responses that technically answer only part of the question.

Clarity & Coherence (18 points) - Assesses whether the answer is well-organized with logical flow. Research shows that coherence and relevance are strong signals of problem-solving quality.

Relevance (18 points) - Ensures all information pertains to the question, avoiding tangential content that confuses the issue. This maintains focus and efficiency.

Conciseness (10 points) - Rewards efficiency by penalizing unnecessary verbosity or repetition while maintaining completeness. This balances against verbose but complete responses.

Appropriateness for Context (9 points) — Checks whether tone, depth, and format match what the questioner likely needs. Technical questions require different treatment than conversational ones.
