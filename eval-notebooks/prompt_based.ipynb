      "The plot of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky revolves around the protagonist, Rodion Raskolnikov, a poor and intellectually prideful former student who murders an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, and grapples with the moral and psychological consequences of his actions. He also kills the pawnbroker's sister, Lizaveta, who happens to witness the crime. As Raskolnikov navigates his guilt and the investigation led by the clever detective Porfiry Petrovich, he is forced to confront his own philosophical justifications for the crime and ultimately confesses, leading to a path of redemption and spiritual renewal.\n"
